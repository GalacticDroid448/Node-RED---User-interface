Node Red
This is a user interface for the Bots. Allows a visual representation of Sensor values whilst it is runnning, like MPU-6050 and HC-SR04 and Rotary Encoders for example. It uses the MQTT protocol and the Raspberry Pi acts as the broker and the ESP32's from each Bot are the clients. 


# Node-RED---User-interface
The Bot now is able to report all of its sensor data to Node RED, a user interface, from here I can also change motor speed's and other values.
